# Robot follows person based on image using ROS and VREP
I implemented this automonous robotic system with ROS Kinetic (Robot operating system) and VREP using only computer vision methods: The robot is able to detect a person
with the YOLOv5n algorithm, and then a calibration camera method is used to calculate the position of the person in real time, finally the robot follows the detected person
by using a P controller.
